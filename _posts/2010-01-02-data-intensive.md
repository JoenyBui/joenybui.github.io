# Data-Intensive

* Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (databases)
* Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (caches)
* Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (searches indexes)
* Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (message queues)
* Observe what is happening, and act on events as they occur (stream processing)
* Periodically crunch a large amount of accumalted data (batch processing)

1. Relaibility
2. Scalability
3. Maintainability
