# MVC Design Pattern

![MVC](https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/MVC-Design-Pattern.png)

Application consists of a data model, presentation information, and control information.  Mostly consisits of UI/interacation layer.

## Model

Model contains pure application data, it contains no logic describing how to present the data to a user.

## View

View presents the model's data to the user.

## Controller

Listens to events triggered by the view (or external source) and executes the appropriate reaction to these events.

## Pros

* Multiple developers can work simultaneous on the model, controller, and views
* logbical grouping of related actions on a controller together.
* Models can have multiple views.

## Cons

* The framework navigations can be complex with new layers of abstractions.
* Multiple technologies.
