# Python

Python is an 

* interpreted language
* dynamically typed
* garbage-collected
* interactive, interpreter, modular, dynamic, object-oreinted, portable, high level, extensible in C++ and C

# Zen
The [Zen of Python (Pep 20)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python), which includes aphorisms such as:

* Beautiful is better than ugly
* Explicit is better than implicit
* Simple is better than complex
* Complex is better than complicated
* Readability counts


## The GOOD

* procedural
* object-oriented (everything is an object)
* functional programming
* easy to read
* dynamically types
* libraries
* free & open-source
* portable
* data science


## The BAD

* runs with interpreter instead of the compiler, so it's many time slower
* not present in mobile
* Global Interpreted Language (GIL) means it's single threaded
* memory intensive
* limitation with database access (?)
* not great for multi-process/multi-core
