# Object Oriented Programming vs. Functional Programming

![VS](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Functional-Programming-vs-OOP.jpg)

Two of the most prevalent programming paridigm is Object Oriented Programminga and Functional Programming.

## What is Object Oriented Programming (OOP)?

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of **objects**, which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes.

* objects are instances of classess, which have data regarding fields, functions, and methods
* objects are first-class citizens

1. Abstraction
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Encapsulation

### Pros

* objects can be easily reused
* objects can be easily created

### Languages Familiar 

* Java
* C++
* Python
* Ruby
* PHP
* Perl
* Objective-C
* Swift
* Dart


## What is Functional Programming?

Functional porgramming is a programming paradigm that treat **functions** as a first class citizen.  It uses avoid changing-state and mutable data.

Functional Programming does not work on executing commands or statements rather it evaluates expressions.

1. High Order Functions (HOF)
2. Pure Functiuons
3. Recursion
4. Strict and Non-Strict Evaluation
5. Type Systems
6. Referential Transparency

### Pros
* Great fit for data science works
* efficiency (?)
* lazy evaluation
* nested functions
* parallel programming


### Languages Familiar

* Scala
* Python (sortof)
* Lisp
* Clojure
* Wolframe
* Erland
* Haskell
* F#
* R
