# Sharding Strategies

Sharding is a method of splitting and storing a single logical dataset in multiple databases.  Sharding allows the database to scale along with it's traffic.

How the data is read affects your sharding strategy choice?
How the data is distributed affects the storage and performance hotspots.  
Redistributing data is important as you scale.

* Vertical Partition --> storing different ables & columns in separate database
* Horizontal Partitioning (sharding) --> storing same tables in multiple database nodes
