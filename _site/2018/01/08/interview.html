<h2 id="five-steps-a-technical-questions">Five Steps a Technical Questions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Ask your interviewer questions to resolve ambiguity.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>What are the data types?</li>
  <li>How much data is there?</li>
  <li>What assumptions do you need to solve the problem.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Design an Algorithm</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>What are the space and time complexities?</li>
  <li>What happens if there is a lot of data?</li>
  <li>Does your design cause other issues?</li>
  <li>If there are other issues, did you make the right trade-offs?</li>
  <li>If they gave you specific data, have you leveraged that information?</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Write pseudo-code first (but tell them).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write your code, not too slow and not too fast.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Use <strong>Data Structures Generously</strong></li>
  <li>Write your code in the upper left hand corner to not crowd.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Test your code and <em>carefully</em> fix any mistakes.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Extreme cases: 0, negative, null, maximums, etc</li>
  <li>User error: What happens if the user passes in null or a negative value?</li>
  <li>General cases: Test the normal case</li>
  <li>Testing while coding if it’s hard code (bit shifting, arithmetic, etc)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="five-algorithm-approaches">Five Algorithm Approaches</h2>

<h3 id="approach-i-examplify">Approach I: Examplify</h3>

<p>Write out specific examples of the problem, and see if you can figure out a general rule.</p>

<h3 id="approach-ii-pattern-matching">Approach II: Pattern Matching</h3>

<p>Consider what problems the algorithm is similar to, and figre out if you can modifying the solution to develop an algorithm for this problem.</p>

<h3 id="approach-iii-simplify--generalize">Approach III: Simplify &amp; Generalize</h3>

<p>Change a constraint (data type, size, etc) to simplify the problem.  Then try to solve it.  Once you have an algorithm for the “simplified” problem, generalize the problem again.</p>

<h3 id="approach-iv-base-case-and-build">Approach IV: Base Case and Build</h3>

<p>Solve the algorithm first for a base case (e.g. just one element).  Then, try to solve it for elements one and two.</p>

<h3 id="approach-v-data-structure-brainstrom">Approach V: Data Structure Brainstrom</h3>

<p>This is hacky, but it often works.  Simply run through a list of data structures and try to apply each one.</p>
