<ul>
  <li>ACID - atomic, consistency, isolations, durability</li>
  <li>atomic - all changes to data are performed as if they are a single operation - all or none</li>
  <li>availability (CAP) - system remains operation 100% of the time</li>
  <li>buisness layer -</li>
  <li>CAP Theorem - a distributed database system can only gurantee two of these three characteristics: consistency, avaliability, and partition tolerance</li>
  <li>cardinality - the number of distinct values. For examle, the cardinality of a table in the database for example is the number of rows.</li>
  <li>ciphers - an algorithm (set of steps) for performing encrytion or decrytion</li>
  <li>concurrent - that task A and task B both needs to happen independently of each other</li>
  <li>consistency (ACID) - data is in a consistent state when a transaction starts and when it ends</li>
  <li>consistency (CAP) = if all the nodes see the same data at the same time</li>
  <li>deadlock (thread) - thread does not know how to restart, therefore remaining stuck</li>
  <li>debounce - a higher order function, which is a function that returns another function.  This is used to make sure that a component, like a typeahead, only runs when user are done typing</li>
  <li>dsl (domain specific language) - sql, json</li>
  <li>durability (ACID) - after a transaction successfully complete, changes to date persist are are not undone, even in the event of a system failure</li>
  <li>eventual consistency</li>
  <li>isolation (ACID) - the intermediate state of a transaction is invisible to other transactions</li>
  <li>keystore - repository where private keys, certificates and symmetric keys can be stored</li>
  <li>Map-reduce</li>
  <li>middleware - software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications</li>
  <li>reverse proxy - type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server. A reverse proxy provides an additional level of abstraction and control to ensure the smooth flow of network traffic between clients and servers.  (common application is load balancing, web acceleration, security and anonymity)</li>
  <li>partition tolerance (CAP) - the system does not fail, regardless of itf messages are dropped or delayed between nodes in a system</li>
  <li>parallel - having different workers working simultaneously</li>
  <li>proxy-server - a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other (evented to add structure and encapsulation to distributed systems)</li>
</ul>
